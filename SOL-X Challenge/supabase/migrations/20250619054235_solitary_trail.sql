/*
  # SOL-X Hero Stories System

  1. New Tables
    - `user_ranks` - Configurable user ranks (Captain, Chief Engineer, etc.)
    - `vessels` - Configurable vessel names (Eagle Bintulu, Eagle Kinabalu, etc.)
    - `story_features` - Configurable feature tags (Fall Detection, Broadcast Message, etc.)
    - `stories` - User submitted stories with published/featured flags
    - `story_feature_tags` - Junction table for story-feature relationships

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on all tables
    - Public read access for published content
    - Authenticated users can manage all content

  3. Sample Data
    - Pre-populated ranks, vessels, and features
    - Sample stories for demonstration
